## This SQL query retrieves unique values from the 'drive_wheels' column in the 'sandbox-project1st.cars.car_info' table. 
Additionally, it calculates the length of each 'drive_wheels' value using the LENGTH function and presents it as 'string_length' in the result set. 
As a result, you'll get a list of distinct drive wheel types along with their corresponding string lengths.

SELECT 
DISTINCT drive_wheels,
LENGTH(drive_wheels) AS string_length
FROM `sandbox-project1st.cars.car_info`
