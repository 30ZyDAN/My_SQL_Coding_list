## This SQL query retrieves data from two tables: 'employees' and 'departments' in the 'sandbox-project1st.employee_data' database. 
It performs a FULL OUTER JOIN operation between the 'employees' and 'departments' tables, linking them based on the 'department_id' column. 
The result set includes columns with aliases for clarity: employees_name (from 'employees.name'), employees_role (from 'employees.role'), and departments_name (from 'departments.name'). 
This query combines employee information with department names, ensuring that all records from both tables are included in the result, even if there are no matching department IDs in either table.

SELECT
employees.name AS employees_name,
employees.role AS employees_role,
departments.name AS departments_name
FROM
sandbox-project1st.employee_data.employees
FULL OUTER JOIN
sandbox-project1st.employee_data.departments ON
employees.department_id = departments.department_id
