## This SQL query retrieves the 'purchase_price' column from the 'customer_purchase' dataset within the 'sandbox-project1st.customer_data' database. 
It then sorts the results in descending order based on the 'purchase_price DESC,' with the highest purchase prices appearing at the top of the result set. 
This allows you to see the purchase prices in decreasing order, helping to identify the most expensive purchases.

SELECT

FROM `sandbox-project1st.customer_data. customer_purchase`
